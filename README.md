## Main Task
The task provided to us was to produce a small game based on escaping from enemies over the course of two maps.  
The first room would have a guard with one out of three possible personalities: rookie, drunk or suspicious. To escape this room, the hero must activate a lever and escape through the main doors, avoiding landing on a tile adjacent to the guard, which would result in a loss.  
The second room would have a variable number of ogres, armed with a weapon. This time, you too have a weapon. Landing on a tile adjacent to the ogre stuns him, yet arriving at a tile adjacent to the weapon would kill you. Your goal is to retrieve the key and escape for full game completion.

## Extra Features
* Quicksaves using the concept of serialization.
* 'Victory' and 'defeat' panels.
* Randomly generated floor (with grass and blood stains).
* Themed game music and sound effects when opening doors.
* Polished level editor that allows precise tile placing and valid map verification.
* Level editor allows maps with up to 625 tiles (25x25 dimension).
* Player may save its custom map and load it through the main menu.
* Tile scaling for smaller/bigger maps instead of window scaling to prevent resolution issues.
* Both WASD and D-pad movement allowed.
* Animations!
