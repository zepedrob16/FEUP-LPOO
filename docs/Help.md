The game is simple. Once you start playing you are presented with a pregame screen with 1 button and a label above that says to either press or avoid it (you have 3 seconds to memorize it). When the screen changes to the actual game you have to press or avoid the buttons that were presented to you. As you progress through the levels the number of buttons increases and the timer diminishes. In the levels multiples of 10 you have to remove all correct buttons presented to you instead of only one. (think of them as boss levels)
