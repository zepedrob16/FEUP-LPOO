AdHunter was developed by Miguel Mano Fernandes and Jos√© Pedro Borges as the final project for a college class named LPOO (Object Oriented Programming Laboratory - OOPL) which was attended in the 2nd year of our degree. Since we didn't want to copy other famous games and make a much less detailed version of them we tried coming up with an original concept for our game, thus boosting our creativity and game developing skills.
